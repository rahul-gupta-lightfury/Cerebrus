# About Dialog Scrollbar Removal

## 1. UI Adjustments
- **Height Increase**: Increased the height of the "About" dialog window from 250px to 300px to accommodate all content without scrolling.
- **Scrollbar Disabled**: Explicitly set `no_scrollbar=True` for the "About" window to ensure the scrollbar does not appear.

The "About" dialog should now display all information cleanly without any visible scrollbars.
