# Code of Conduct

This project aims to provide a professional, respectful environment for all contributors.

- Treat others with respect and assume good intent.
- Provide constructive feedback focused on the work, not the person.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, or demeaning behavior.
- Respect different levels of experience and background.
- Collaborate in good faith to improve the project.

Maintainers may take appropriate action if behavior violates these principles, including:
- Requesting a change in tone or approach.
- Limiting access to collaboration channels.
- In severe or repeated cases, restricting contribution rights.

If you experience or observe behavior that conflicts with this Code of Conduct, report it to the maintainers privately with as much context as possible.
